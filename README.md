# 🎓 Campus Well-being & Productivity Database

This project helps university administrators and student welfare teams analyze how campus environments, schedules, and services affect student well-being and academic productivity.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/docs` → Documentation (requirements, schema design, ER diagrams)
- `/schemas` → SQL scripts and migrations
- `/src` → Data ingestion and utility scripts
- `/data-samples` → Sample anonymized datasets
- `/notebooks` → Analysis and reporting notebooks

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install PostgreSQL or MySQL.
2. Run schema scripts in `/schemas`.
3. Load sample data from `/data-samples`.
4. Explore queries in `/notebooks`.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Link **campus environments** (noise, lighting, crowding) with **student well-being** (surveys, counseling visits).
- Analyze **schedules** (course times, workload) and **service usage** (library, counseling, fitness).
- Provide **normalized schema** and reproducible queries for administrators.
